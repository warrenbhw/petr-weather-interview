We're building an AI application that allows a user to ask about the weather at their location
and get recommendations on how to prepare for the day.

We're going to use Weather APIs, such as the National Weather Service weather API
https://api.weather.gov/

Our stack is:

- React
- Vite
- bun
- tailwindCSS
- Vercel AI SDK
- Hono on the backend

Our backend lives in the packages/backend directory, and our frontend will live in the packages/frontend directory.

Coding conventions:

- All TypeScript/TSX files should use kebab-case naming (e.g., weather-display.tsx, use-weather.ts)
- Components should still be exported with PascalCase names
- Use prettier-standard for code formatting
